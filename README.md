# **Welcome to the FIFO Fridge!**

[screenshot of finished application here]

# **About**
This is a single-page application that renders/ displays content with Javascript  
(the frontend) and manages local API data via Rails (the backend).

Users can track which foods are about to expire in their fridge (organized by  
expiration date).


# **Installation**

1. Fork/ clone this repo to your local machine; `cd` into the project.

2. **Backend**  
 i. `cd` into `fifo-fridge-app-backend`  
 ii. run `bundle install` to install gem dependencies  
 iii. run `rails db:migrate` to migrate model data to DB  
 iv. run `rails db:seed` to implement default seed data. (run `rails c` to ensure the data was seeded correctly)  
 v. run `rails s` to start the server

3. **Frontend**  
  i. run `open index.html` in your editor; the web page should automatically load a browser.
