JavaScript (frontend)
* [X] Use classes and functions to organize your code into reusable pieces.  
* [X] Translate JSON responses into JavaScript model objects using ES6 class or constructor function syntax.  
* [X] Use ES6 features when appropriate (e.g. arrow functions, let & const, rest and spread syntax)  

Rails (backend)
* [X] Follow Rails MVC and RESTful conventions. That means, for example, that a request GET /fridges ought to be handled by the FridgesController, fetch fridges from the database using a Fridge Active Record model, and return a list of fridges as JSON.  
* [X] Well-named variables and methods  
* [X] Short, single-purpose method  

Git (version-control)
* [X] Aim for a large number of small commits - commit frequently! (min. 50)  
* [X] Add meaningful messages to your commits. When you look back at your commits with git log, the messages should describe each change.  
* [X] Don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message
